Your task is to generate diverse, 'in-the-wild' job posting titles for a given list of 'clean' job titles. These generated titles should reflect what one might find on job boards like LinkedIn or Indeed. They often contain extra details not found in a standardized job title.

**Instructions:**
For each 'clean' job title provided, generate a list of 2 'in-the-wild' job titles.

**Key objective:** Create variations that are semantically related but use different phrasing and keywords. The goal is to train a model to understand that titles like "Software Engineer" and "Application Developer" are very similar.

To achieve this, your generated titles should include a mix of the following variations:

1.  **Alternative Keywords:** Generate titles that are semantically similar but use different keywords.
    *   *Example:* For "Software Engineer", you could generate "Application Developer" or "Backend Coder".

2.  **Seniority & Experience Level:** Add terms that specify experience.
    *   *Example:* "Junior Accountant", "Senior Product Manager", "Lead Data Scientist", "Principal Software Architect".

3.  **Technical Skills & Specializations:** Include specific technologies, programming languages, or certifications.
    *   *Example:* "Java Software Engineer", "React Front-End Developer", "AWS Cloud Engineer", "CPA Staff Accountant".

4.  **Job Context & Descriptors:** Add common job posting phrases related to location, team, or urgency.
    *   *Example:* "Remote Marketing Manager (West Coast)", "Urgent Hire: Registered Nurse", "Join our R&D Team as a Research Scientist".

5.  **Vary Formatting:** Use different punctuation and sentence structures. Be creative and imaginative.
